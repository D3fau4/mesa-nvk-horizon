## Current phase

**Phase 1 — `horizon/` standalone GPU layer. COMPLETE — VERIFIED ON REAL
HARDWARE, including the post-Codex-review fixes.**

Following the 9 Codex review fixes in `2dc8513` (see "Codex PR review"
below), the owner rebuilt and re-ran all ten `.nro`s on a real Switch and
confirmed all ten pass. This round was reported as a verbal confirmation
("los 10 dan positivo") without captured logs or per-test PASS/FAIL
counts, unlike the first hardware round below — recorded here as such,
not padded with numbers that were not actually reported. This closes the
"verified-pending-reconfirmation" state the Codex fixes had left Phase 1
in, in particular for the two paths that changed behaviour materially:
`t_channel`'s notifier handling (now matching `KERNELRESULT(TimedOut)`
specifically) and `t_submit`'s R10 measurement (rebuilt as a real
producer/consumer cross-channel wait).

The owner ran all ten `.nro`s on a real Switch (logs received
2026-07-26); 8/10 passed outright and the two failures were fixed
(a wrong assumption about `GetErrorNotification` semantics in
`channel.c`, and a benign race in the t_teardown test). The
**confirmation re-run passed both**: `t_channel` PASS 17/17 (notifier
now reports `status=ok type=0 'none'`; syncpt value at create 58686 —
further R5 evidence the counter persists across runs) and `t_teardown`
PASS 28/28 (both cycles landed on the work-already-retired side of the
race; retirement callbacks ran exactly once; leak refusal and zero
counters held in both cycles). Evidence: console screenshots from the
owner (the second run's verdicts were captured on screen; the sdmc log
files were reported missing — note the tests write them to
`sdmc:/horizon_gpu_tests/` at the SD root, not next to the `.nro`s).

## Hardware run results (real Switch, owner-executed, 2026-07-26)

| # | Test | Result | Key output |
|---|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | t_init | **PASS 22/22** | gm20b arch=0x120 impl=0xb rev=0xa1, 1 GPC × 2 TPC, L2 0x40000, va_bits=40, big_page=0x20000 (avail 0x30000), classes 3d=0xb197 compute=0xb1c0 2d=0x902d gpfifo=0xb06f i2m=0xa140 copy=0xb0b5; small region base=0x8000000 pages=0x3f7fff; big region base=0x400000000 pages=0xdffff |
| 2 | t_alloc | **PASS 21/21** | rounding, alignment, every overflow rejection |
| 3 | t_nvmap | **PASS 16/16** | ids/handles valid and distinct, close path healthy |
| 4 | t_va_reserve | **PASS 17/17** | small base=0x8000000; big base=0x400000000 inside queried region; oversized reservation → clean nv error **0x275c** (R8 exhaustion behaviour) |
| 5 | t_map | **PASS 26/26** | fixed VA honoured, cleared-VA invariant holds, remap after unmap works, **Generic_16BX2 kind OK**, **big-page (0x20000) map OK** (R9) |
| 6 | t_channel | FAIL 16/17 → **fixed** | syncpt id=26, **value at create=14064** (R5: counters NOT reset at channel creation — shadow-from-read design is required and correct). The one FAIL: `GetErrorNotification` returns a failed Result on a healthy channel — Horizon semantics are "error when nothing pending"; get_error now treats that as "none" |
| 7 | t_submit | **PASS 23/23** | fence-only submit executes (validates the WFI+SYNCPOINTA/B increment encoding, R4); NOP list executes; **2 submits in flight, both issued in 148 µs, no CPU wait**; SET_OBJECT binds complete without fault (R7); **R3: entry flags 0 accepted and completed**; **R10: GPU-side syncpoint wait completed — encoding VALIDATED** |
| 8 | t_syncpt | **PASS 48/48** | exactly +1 per submit across 10 submits (initial value 26545); shadow agrees with hardware |
| 9 | t_fence_wait | **PASS 14/14** | wait-after-completion, prompt signalled return, 200 ms timeout honoured without unit inflation, zero-timeout poll |
| 10 | t_teardown | FAIL 31/32 → **test fixed** | cycle 1: in-flight destroy refused (BUSY) as required; cycle 2: the NOP work had already retired so the probe destroy legitimately succeeded and the test then double-destroyed. Both outcomes are legal; the test now handles the race. All leak accounting held in both cycles |

### Measurements recorded (design consequences)

- **R5 answered:** syncpoints are NOT reset at channel creation (14064 /
  26545 observed). Initialising the 64-bit shadow from a hardware read is
  mandatory, and is what the code does.
- **R10 answered:** the SYNCPOINTA/B GPU-side wait encoding works on the
  Horizon nv path. Cross-channel GPU dependencies (Phase 4) are unblocked.
- **R3 revised:** GPFIFO entry flags 0 **work** through our submit path —
  the reference's NOT_MAIN|NO_PREFETCH folklore is not reproducible on
  this code. Default stays NOT_MAIN|NO_PREFETCH (matches the only
  hardware-proven full stack) until Phase 4 retests with real engine
  workloads; recorded as measured, not inherited.
- **R4 validated:** one increment requested = one increment observed,
  48/48.
- **R8 data:** oversized ALLOC_SPACE fails cleanly with nv Result 0x275c.
- **Horizon semantics finding:** `NVGPU_IOCTL_CHANNEL_GET_ERROR_NOTIFICATION`
  fails when no notification is pending (fresh-channel measurement);
  `horizon_gpu_channel_get_error` treats that failure as "none".

---

## Fixes after the first run — CONFIRMED on console

1. `horizon/channel/channel.c` — `get_error` treats a failed
   GetErrorNotification as "no notification pending" (cites the
   measurement). Confirmed: `t_channel` PASS 17/17 on the re-run.
2. `tests/t_teardown.c` — the in-flight-destroy probe accepts both legal
   outcomes (BUSY while in flight / success when already retired) without
   double-destroying. Confirmed: `t_teardown` PASS 28/28 on the re-run
   (both cycles took the already-retired branch).

## Tests executed in this environment (unchanged classes)

| Command | Class | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/run-host-tests.sh` (gcc 13.3, x86_64, ASan+UBSan) | host build+run | 78/78 PASS (h_align 20, h_va_space 21, h_syncpt_math 19, h_cmds 18) |
| `scripts/check-layering.sh` | host run | OK |
| `docker run … nx-dev make all -j4` (post-fix) | cross build | exit 0, 10/10 `.nro`, `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` clean |

---

## Phase 1 exit criteria — verification state

| Criterion | State |
|---|---|
| Ten tests cross-compile (X) | ✅ |
| Pure logic builds/runs on host (H) | ✅ 78/78 |
| Layering gate clean | ✅ |
| Tests 1–10 pass on hardware (HW) | ✅ **all ten PASS** (8/10 first run + t_channel 17/17 and t_teardown 28/28 on the confirmation re-run) |
| ≥2 submits in flight without CPU wait (test 7) | ✅ **verified on hardware** (148 µs for both submits, single wait at the end) |

**Every Phase 1 exit criterion is met.**

---

## Known failures / limitations

- **R6 (cache coherency) still unmeasured** — needs a GPU write primitive
  (inline-to-memory/DMA), deferred to the first GPU write (early
  Phase 4/5). Deliberate, recorded deviation.
- **Kickoff rejection code map** still unpopulated: no kickoff was ever
  rejected during the run (good), so BUSY-vs-other classification remains
  based on the libnx-side queue precheck only.
- The submit rollback paths touch libnx's public `NvGpuChannel` fields;
  correct against libnx as pinned in the nx-dev image.

## Pending decisions

| # | Decision | State |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Literal reuse from GPL/AGPL reference | **no**; nothing copied |
| D4 | Switch available | **yes — closed.** Full run + confirmation re-run done |
| D2/D3 | Mesa pin / checkout mechanism | due at Phase 2 start |
| D5 | Cache policy per memory type | blocked on R6 (first GPU write) |
| D6 | Timeline semaphores vs upload queue | Phase 4 |

## Codex PR review (2026-07-26) — findings addressed

`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` reviewed commit `b1c53f0a5c` (PR #1) and left
9 comments. All are real; fixed here (host + cross build clean, `-Wall
-Wextra -Werror`, host tests 78/78, layering gate OK) — **hardware re-run
still pending**, since several touch code paths already measured on
console (t_channel's notifier fix, t_submit's R10 measurement).

| # | File:line | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tests/t_submit.c:192` (P2) | R10 test waited on the consumer's own already-reached syncpoint — proved nothing about the encoding | Redesigned as a real producer/consumer pair: wait on a *future* threshold on a different channel's syncpoint, assert a short wait times out while unresolved, then assert it unblocks after the producer submits. Re-measures R10; the old "encoding VALIDATED" note undersold what was actually proven |
| 2 | `horizon/channel/channel.c:432` | `wait_fence` read `chan`'s own syncpoint regardless of `fence.syncpt_id`, so a foreign-channel fence could compare the wrong counter | Validate `fence.syncpt_id == chan->syncpt_id`, matching `add_retirement`'s existing check |
| 3 | `horizon/channel/channel.c:513` (P1) | A lost channel with pending retirements could never destroy: `!chan->lost` gated both the busy check *and* the reap, and nothing ever clears `retire_count` | Always reap (a plain syncpt read, harmless on a lost channel); if entries remain on a *lost* channel, force-retire them (documented as "abandoned", not "completed" — no cancellation ioctl exists) instead of refusing destroy forever |
| 4 | `horizon/vm/vm.c:269` | Unmapping the most-recently-created mapping zeroed `mem->mapped_va` even if an older mapping of the same object was still live, contradicting the documented "0 = no live mapping" contract | Added an intrusive most-recent-first list of live mappings per `horizon_gpu_mem` (`mem_priv.h`/`vm_priv.h`); unmap now restores `mapped_va` to another live mapping if one remains |
| 5 | `tests/t_submit.c:116` | If `make_nop_list` failed, `span` was uninitialised but the next section submitted it anyway | Gated the multi-submit section on the same success flag as the NOP-list section |
| 6 | `horizon/submit/submit.c:133` (P1) | Shadow/kernel fence mismatch was logged but still returned success with the (untrustworthy) shadow-derived fence | Marks the channel lost and returns `HORIZON_GPU_ERR_CHANNEL_LOST` instead — the submit already reached hardware and cannot be undone, but no caller gets a fence it can't trust |
| 7 | `horizon/channel/channel.c:81` | `get_error` treated *every* failed `GetErrorNotification` as "no error", which would mask a genuine service/driver failure as a healthy channel | Verified against libnx source (`nx/source/nvidia/gpu_channel.c`, fetched from github.com/switchbrew/libnx): "no notification pending" is the non-blocking `eventWait(..., 0)`'s own `KERNELRESULT(TimedOut)`, not an nv error. Now matches that exact result only; anything else propagates as a real failure |
| 8 | `horizon/device/device.c:140` | When `as_big_page_size` selected a non-default (but valid) size, `dev->info.big_page_size` kept the characteristics default, so `vm_page_size_valid` validated reservations against the wrong value | Store the effective `as_big_page` into `dev->info.big_page_size` before `nvAddressSpaceCreate` |
| 9 | `horizon/vm/vm.c:210` | If `MapBufferEx` returned an unexpected VA *and* the cleanup `UnmapBuffer` also failed, the interval and mapping bookkeeping were freed anyway — an orphaned kernel mapping with the device/mem counters reporting no leak | On that double-failure, keep the VA interval and both live-mapping counters non-reusable/elevated and return `HORIZON_GPU_ERR_LEAK` instead of freeing the bookkeeping |

Also fixed while rebuilding: `Makefile`'s per-recipe `mkdir -p $(dir $@)`
raced under `make -j4` on this toolchain image's overlay filesystem — one
object file's compile silently never ran and `ar` failed. Object
directories are now order-only prerequisites created by a single rule.
Confirmed: `-j4` clean after the fix (previously reproduced the failure
twice, `-j1` always worked).

**Re-run on hardware:** owner-confirmed all ten `.nro`s pass after these
fixes (2026-07-26, verbal confirmation, no logs/per-test counts captured
this round — see "Current phase" above).

## Next concrete task

**Phase 2 — toolchain** (`docs/milestones.md`), pending the owner's
go-ahead:

1. Pin devkitA64 / libnx / nx-dev image versions in
   `toolchain/versions.env` (today they are pinned only implicitly by the
   image digest).
2. Meson cross file `toolchain/horizon-aarch64.cross`; decide D2 (Mesa
   version) and D3 (submodule vs fetched checkout) at phase start.
3. `scripts/check-no-abs-paths.sh` gate and idempotent fetch/configure/
   build/package scripts.
