## Phase 1 (previous phase)

**`horizon/` standalone GPU layer. Hardware-verified through
the Codex review round (see below); a second, owner-authored review
round (2026-07-26, same day) found 20 further issues in `horizon/` and
`tests/`, now fixed (host + cross build green, host tests 81 -> 103) but
NOT yet re-run on hardware — see "Second review round" below. Treat
Phase 1 as verified-pending-reconfirmation again until that re-run
happens; the changed paths include channel creation/destroy, vm_map,
device big-page-size handling and the GPFIFO command emitters, several
of which are exercised by every other test.**

Following the 9 Codex review fixes in `2dc8513` (see "Codex PR review"
below), the owner rebuilt and re-ran all ten `.nro`s on a real Switch and
confirmed all ten pass. This round was reported as a verbal confirmation
("los 10 dan positivo") without captured logs or per-test PASS/FAIL
counts, unlike the first hardware round below — recorded here as such,
not padded with numbers that were not actually reported. This closes the
"verified-pending-reconfirmation" state the Codex fixes had left Phase 1
in, in particular for the two paths that changed behaviour materially:
`t_channel`'s notifier handling (now matching `KERNELRESULT(TimedOut)`
specifically) and `t_submit`'s R10 measurement (rebuilt as a real
producer/consumer cross-channel wait).

The owner ran all ten `.nro`s on a real Switch (logs received
2026-07-26); 8/10 passed outright and the two failures were fixed
(a wrong assumption about `GetErrorNotification` semantics in
`channel.c`, and a benign race in the t_teardown test). The
**confirmation re-run passed both**: `t_channel` PASS 17/17 (notifier
now reports `status=ok type=0 'none'`; syncpt value at create 58686 —
further R5 evidence the counter persists across runs) and `t_teardown`
PASS 28/28 (both cycles landed on the work-already-retired side of the
race; retirement callbacks ran exactly once; leak refusal and zero
counters held in both cycles). Evidence: console screenshots from the
owner (the second run's verdicts were captured on screen; the sdmc log
files were reported missing — note the tests write them to
`sdmc:/horizon_gpu_tests/` at the SD root, not next to the `.nro`s).

## Hardware run results (real Switch, owner-executed, 2026-07-26)

| # | Test | Result | Key output |
|---|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | t_init | **PASS 22/22** | gm20b arch=0x120 impl=0xb rev=0xa1, 1 GPC × 2 TPC, L2 0x40000, va_bits=40, big_page=0x20000 (avail 0x30000), classes 3d=0xb197 compute=0xb1c0 2d=0x902d gpfifo=0xb06f i2m=0xa140 copy=0xb0b5; small region base=0x8000000 pages=0x3f7fff; big region base=0x400000000 pages=0xdffff |
| 2 | t_alloc | **PASS 21/21** | rounding, alignment, every overflow rejection |
| 3 | t_nvmap | **PASS 16/16** | ids/handles valid and distinct, close path healthy |
| 4 | t_va_reserve | **PASS 17/17** | small base=0x8000000; big base=0x400000000 inside queried region; oversized reservation → clean nv error **0x275c** (R8 exhaustion behaviour) |
| 5 | t_map | **PASS 26/26** | fixed VA honoured, cleared-VA invariant holds, remap after unmap works, **Generic_16BX2 kind OK**, **big-page (0x20000) map OK** (R9) |
| 6 | t_channel | FAIL 16/17 → **fixed** | syncpt id=26, **value at create=14064** (R5: counters NOT reset at channel creation — shadow-from-read design is required and correct). The one FAIL: `GetErrorNotification` returns a failed Result on a healthy channel — Horizon semantics are "error when nothing pending"; get_error now treats that as "none" |
| 7 | t_submit | **PASS 23/23** | fence-only submit executes (validates the WFI+SYNCPOINTA/B increment encoding, R4); NOP list executes; **2 submits in flight, both issued in 148 µs, no CPU wait**; SET_OBJECT binds complete without fault (R7); **R3: entry flags 0 accepted and completed**; **R10: GPU-side syncpoint wait completed — encoding VALIDATED** |
| 8 | t_syncpt | **PASS 48/48** | exactly +1 per submit across 10 submits (initial value 26545); shadow agrees with hardware |
| 9 | t_fence_wait | **PASS 14/14** | wait-after-completion, prompt signalled return, 200 ms timeout honoured without unit inflation, zero-timeout poll |
| 10 | t_teardown | FAIL 31/32 → **test fixed** | cycle 1: in-flight destroy refused (BUSY) as required; cycle 2: the NOP work had already retired so the probe destroy legitimately succeeded and the test then double-destroyed. Both outcomes are legal; the test now handles the race. All leak accounting held in both cycles |

### Measurements recorded (design consequences)

- **R5 answered:** syncpoints are NOT reset at channel creation (14064 /
  26545 observed). Initialising the 64-bit shadow from a hardware read is
  mandatory, and is what the code does.
- **R10 answered:** the SYNCPOINTA/B GPU-side wait encoding works on the
  Horizon nv path. Cross-channel GPU dependencies (Phase 4) are unblocked.
- **R3 revised:** GPFIFO entry flags 0 **work** through our submit path —
  the reference's NOT_MAIN|NO_PREFETCH folklore is not reproducible on
  this code. Default stays NOT_MAIN|NO_PREFETCH (matches the only
  hardware-proven full stack) until Phase 4 retests with real engine
  workloads; recorded as measured, not inherited.
- **R4 validated:** one increment requested = one increment observed,
  48/48.
- **R8 data:** oversized ALLOC_SPACE fails cleanly with nv Result 0x275c.
- **Horizon semantics finding:** `NVGPU_IOCTL_CHANNEL_GET_ERROR_NOTIFICATION`
  fails when no notification is pending (fresh-channel measurement);
  `horizon_gpu_channel_get_error` treats that failure as "none".

## Fixes after the first run — CONFIRMED on console

1. `horizon/channel/channel.c` — `get_error` treats a failed
   GetErrorNotification as "no notification pending" (cites the
   measurement). Confirmed: `t_channel` PASS 17/17 on the re-run.
2. `tests/t_teardown.c` — the in-flight-destroy probe accepts both legal
   outcomes (BUSY while in flight / success when already retired) without
   double-destroying. Confirmed: `t_teardown` PASS 28/28 on the re-run
   (both cycles took the already-retired branch).

## Tests executed in this environment (unchanged classes)

| Command | Class | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/run-host-tests.sh` (gcc 13.3, x86_64, ASan+UBSan) | host build+run | 78/78 PASS (h_align 20, h_va_space 21, h_syncpt_math 19, h_cmds 18) |
| `scripts/check-layering.sh` | host run | OK |
| `docker run … nx-dev make all -j4` (post-fix) | cross build | exit 0, 10/10 `.nro`, `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` clean |

## Phase 1 exit criteria — verification state

| Criterion | State |
|---|---|
| Ten tests cross-compile (X) | ✅ |
| Pure logic builds/runs on host (H) | ✅ 103/103 |
| Layering gate clean | ✅ |
| Tests 1–10 pass on hardware (HW) | ✅ **all ten PASS, on the current code, in both process modes** (2026-07-27 — see "Hardware run of all eleven `.nro`" above). Applet and full/game agree test for test; the counts are higher than the Phase 1 run because the second review round added assertions to exactly these paths |
| ≥2 submits in flight without CPU wait (test 7) | ✅ **re-measured on hardware**: both submits issued in **149 µs** with no intervening CPU wait, and the bound is now `t_check`ed rather than noted (148 µs at `732b58c`) |

**Every Phase 1 exit criterion is met, and the two hardware ones are no
longer stale.** They were measured at `732b58c` and `horizon/` changed
afterwards in `747b915`, which is why they sat at ⚠️ through Phases 2
and 3 — a ✅ would have claimed console evidence for code no console had
run. The 2026-07-27 run closes that: it exercised the current code,
including every path the second review round touched (channel
create/destroy, `vm_map`, device big-page handling, the GPFIFO
emitters), and found no regression in either mode.
